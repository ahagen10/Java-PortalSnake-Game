# PortalSnake
Description: This game combines elements from the classic game of Snake (aka Nibble) with the modern puzzle game Portal. In this game, there are various levels where you maneuver a snake to collect apples that extend the length of its body. You win by collecting all of the apples on a given level. However colliding with any rocks or with your own body will end your game with a loss. The twist on this classic Snake gameplay, are pairs of portals that teleport the snake from one part of the screen to another.

Goals: 
•	Learn to instantiate and use methods from various classes.
•	Understand the difference between static and non-static class methods.
•	Organize your own code into classes for modularity and code re-usability.
•	Become more familiar with the architecture of real-time simulations and games.
•	Gain experience using ArrayList collections of different object types.
•	Create a basic computer game that can be expanded with many fun new features.
•	Implement game logic with existing engine code classes (Application, Engine, GraphicObject) to draw text and graphics to the screen, detect user inputs, and perform collision calculations between objects.
